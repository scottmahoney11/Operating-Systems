One function of an operating system is providing a user interface. A user interface is how a user controls software or hardware device. A good user interface, or UI, is user friendly and makes it easy to navigate and use hardware. A command-line interface is used to configure devices, automate system management tasks, and troubleshoot network connections using commands represented by short keywords, such as "dir" to view file directories.
