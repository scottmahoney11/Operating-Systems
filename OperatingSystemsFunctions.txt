One function of an operating system is providing a user interface. A user interface is how a user controls software or hardware device. A good user interface, or UI, is user friendly and makes it easy to navigate and use hardware.
A second function of an operating system is managing memory. It does so by keeping track of each memory location, either allocated or free. It determines how memory is allocated to competing programs, deciding which programs get memory, how much the programs receive, and what order they receive it in.
A third function of operating systems is administering security. Administrator accounts have access to all files and programs, can install programs, and specify settings that all user accounts on a computer, mobile device, or network are affected by, called "permissions". They can also create these user accounts, which can be signed into by users with a username.
