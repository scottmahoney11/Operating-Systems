One function of an operating system is providing a user interface. A user interface is how a user controls software or hardware device. A good user interface, or UI, is user friendly and makes it easy to navigate and use hardware. A command-line interface is used to configure devices, automate system management tasks, and troubleshoot network connections using commands represented by short keywords, such as "dir" to view file directories.
A second function of an operating system is managing memory. It does so by keeping track of each memory location, either allocated or free. It determines how memory is allocated to competing programs, deciding which programs get memory, how much the programs receive, and what order they receive it in.
